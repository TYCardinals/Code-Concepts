What are Generators?

Generators are functions that you can use for controlling the iterator. 
In comparison with regular functions that return a single value or nothing,
generators return multiple values in a sequence, one after another. 
They operate great with iterables and allow creating data streams with ease.

Generator functions are different from regular ones. 
Every time a function like that is called, it doesn’t run its code. 
Alternatively, it returns a particular object, called “generator object” 
for managing the execution.
